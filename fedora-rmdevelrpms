# This script is useful in cleaning up development RPMs from your system,
# eg. when starting to make a new RPM package.
#
# Currently, "development RPMs" include:
# - Any package whose %{NAME} ends with "-devel", except gcc requirements.
# - Ones listed in $DEVPKGS below.
# - Ones in $ADDITIONAL_DEVEL_RPMS (see below).
#
# If you want to keep some devel RPMs around, put their names into the
# $KEEP_DEVEL_RPMS environment variable, separated by space.  The opposite
# of this is provided by $ADDITIONAL_DEVEL_RPMS.
#
# You can persist these settings in the system-wide configuration file
# /etc/fedora/develrpms.conf or a per-user ~/.develrpmsrc.
